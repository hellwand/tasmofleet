# Regenerates tools/mutation-weights.txt: per file of every MUTATION package the number of
# runnable (covered) mutants, from a gremlins dry run; a file with none gets a 0 line, so that it is
# told apart from a file nobody measured yet (tools/mutation-shard.sh estimates that one by its size).
# tools/mutation-shard.sh multiplies the count by the package's cost line to deal files out to the CI
# shards (make mutation-plan shows the result). The "cost" lines are seconds per mutant x 100, measured
# from the weekly runs (weekly.yml, mutation jobs); keep them when regenerating, update them by hand
# when the shards drift apart again: compare each shard's duration with the estimate of the plan.
