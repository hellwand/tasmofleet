// Scheduled starts (#603). A job submitted with Request.StartAt is stored as model.JobScheduled. It holds its
// device against other TasmoFleet jobs (ota_jobs_one_active, activeStates) but gets no worker and no slot. The
// engine loop (Run, schedule) looks at the scheduled jobs whenever it wakes and wakes through the engine
// clock at the earliest start. When a start has come (schedule.At is Run, which includes a late start within
// schedule.LateStart after TasmoFleet was down), the device must pass the start check of the application
// (Options.StartCheck: the device lock and the firmware holds, as a person's Submit) and must not be excluded
// from OTA; the job then becomes queued (event start_due) and runs the normal preflight, so identity, Guard
// and plan are checked again. A start that passed by more than the window ends the job cancelled and
// NotStarted (event not_started); it never starts later.

// startRetry is how soon a start the device refused (a person's operation or TasmoFleet's own short read
// holds the device, or a firmware update typed in the console is still running) is tried again, inside the
// window.

// timer counts monotonic time, which stands still while the host sleeps; the start must follow the wall clock.
