// Why (#716): "Discovered device #5" says nothing once the proposal is gone. An entry for ignoring or
// restoring a discovered device names the device on the audit page (target column, which stays visible
// on a phone, name first because the cell cuts its end), and older entries with an empty detail keep rendering as before. The name is text a
// device announced on the network: it must come out escaped.
