# Command policy: what the console may send, and what may be logged

Scope: `internal/cmdpolicy` (pure classifier, reply scrubber), `internal/devicecmd`
(the only sender of free-form commands), `internal/web/console.go` and `power.go`.
Review findings are judged against this document. Every claim has a test.

## Model

**Decision 2026-10-21 (maintainer): "admins may do everything".** TasmoAdmin had only the
admin, and tasmofleet's console and bulk command are admin tools. The earlier allowlist
and the "forbidden for everyone" class are **superseded** by this model; the superseded
claims stay below, struck through in words, so a reviewer sees what changed and why.

- A command line is **one** command: `Name<index> <args>`. `cmdpolicy.Canonical` is
  the exact text that is judged and sent. Callers never send their original string.
  The one exception to "one command" is `Backlog`: it may hold ASCII `;`, and every
  part is judged on its own like a command sent alone.
- Classes: **read** and **operator** (operator role), **admin** (admin role only). The
  zero class and `forbidden` are never sendable; `forbidden` exists only for malformed
  lines. There is **no allowlist**; the only commands no role sends are `FileDownload`, `FileUpload`
  and `Upload` (their payload carries the device's MQTT password; tasmofleet's own file-transfer code sends
  them), alone or in a `Backlog`.
- **Confirmation instead of refusal.** A destructive or lock-out command is still sent
  for an admin, but `Verdict.Confirm` names the consequence and the UI asks exactly
  once before it sends. Routine commands never get a second screen. The commands are
  `Reset`, `WifiConfig`, `Upgrade`, `Upload` and `OtaUrl` with arguments, `Wifi` with
  off or unclear arguments, `WebServer` with anything but the bare query and `2`,
  `IPAddress<n>`, `Ethernet` and `Ap` with arguments, `Module` and `Template` with
  arguments, `Restart` other than `Restart 1`, every credential command with
  arguments, and `Status 0` in every spelling (a warning). A `Backlog` asks when any
  of its parts would.
- `devicecmd.Run` is the single entry point (`cmdpolicy.Prepare`: authorise, then
  canonicalise). The web layer adds the confirmation screen but no authority.
- Power switching builds its command from validated integers (relay 1 to 8, ON, OFF,
  TOGGLE) and classifies it again before sending.
- Automated code is not affected: it never sends `Status 0` (safety rule 2), and it
  never sends firmware commands outside the OTA engine behind `fwselect.Guard`.

## Claims

| ID  | Claim | Tests |
| --- | ----- | ----- |
| P1  | A line that could make the device run a second command or hides what is sent (`;` outside a `Backlog`, look-alike semicolons, `%3B`, control, invisible, bidirectional and non-UTF-8 characters, over-long lines, bad names) is malformed: `ErrInvalid`, never sent. The same checks apply to every part of a `Backlog`. | `TestClassifyRejectsInjection`, `FuzzPolicy` |
| P2  | **Superseded 2026-10-21 (admins may do everything).** Was: command executors (`Backlog`, `Json`, `Rule`, `RuleTimer`, `If`, `Event`, `Publish`, `Publish2`, `WebSend`, `WebQuery`, `WebGetConfig`, `UfsRun`, `Script`, `Br`, `SendMail`, `Var`, `Mem`, `DevGroupSend`, `Telnet`, `LoRaCommand`, `SetOption85` with an argument, `Timer`, `Timers`, `Subscribe`, `Unsubscribe`, `PublishRetain`) forbidden for every role. Now they are plain admin commands. Only a `Backlog` is looked into, so a `Reset` inside it asks like a `Reset` alone; the other executors are not inspected. Over MQTT the command channel refuses those that can run a command on TasmoFleet's behalf (`Json`, `Publish`, `Publish2`, `Rule` with a rule text, `RuleTimer`, `If`, `WebSend`, `WebQuery`, `DevGroupSend`, `LoRaCommand`, `Br`, `Script`, `UfsRun`: mqtt-transport T1); they go over HTTP. | `TestClassify`, `TestBacklogInheritsConfirmations` |
| P3  | **Superseded 2026-10-21.** Was: `Reset`, `WifiConfig`, `Upgrade`, `Upload`, `OtaUrl`, `Restart` other than `Restart 1`, `Wifi` off, `WebServer` other than the bare query and `2`, `IPAddress<n>`, `Ethernet`, `Ap` and `Status 0` forbidden. Now each of them is an admin command with one confirmation naming the consequence (`Confirm`); `Status 0` is allowed with a warning on that step. | `TestClassify`, `TestBoundaries`, `FuzzPolicy`, `TestEveryFixtureCommandIsClassified` |
| P4  | **Superseded 2026-10-21.** Was: credential commands forbidden in the console. Now `Password<n>`, `WebPassword`, `MqttPassword`, `SSId<n>`, `TmToken`, `IfxPassword`, `IfxToken`, `IfxUser`, `TLSKey<n>`, `LoRaWanAppKey<n>`, `RgxPassword`, `RgxSSId`, `WiFiTest<n>` (a Wi-Fi name and password to try), the BLE bind keys of `MI32Key` and `MI32Keys<n>` and the Zigbee network key of `ZbConfig` are admin commands with a confirmation (the keys' confirmation names their own consequence, not a login: a sensor that can no longer be read; a restart and dropped Zigbee devices); the verdict is marked `Redact` (a bare `ZbConfig` too: its reply shows the key), their arguments never reach any log (L1), and while HTTP works they go over HTTP (mqtt-transport T11). From the console and bulk commands every command whose arguments L1 hides keeps HTTP first while HTTP works, whatever its name (`ShownInFull`, T11). | `TestClassify`, `TestKeyCommandsNameTheirOwnConsequence`, `TestConsoleCredentialCommandsAreConfirmedAndRedacted`, `TestSecretWritesStayHTTPFirstWhileHTTPWorks`, `TestShownInFull`, `TestRunKeepsCommandsTheAuditHidesHTTPFirstWhileHTTPWorks` |
| P8  | **Superseded 2026-10-21.** Was: an allowlist; unknown names (`Sensor13`, `SetSensor`, driver and Zigbee commands) were refused with `ErrUnknown`. Now a name nobody listed is an admin command; an operator is refused it with `ErrRole`. | `TestAnyNameIsAdminOnly` |
| P5  | An operator can send only read and operator class commands: `Status 1..11`, queries without arguments, `Power<1..8> ON/OFF/TOGGLE` (also the numeric forms `0`, `1`, `2`, which mean the same), `Restart 1`. `Power0`, relays above 8, bare `SaveData` (writes flash), `MqttUser`, every unlisted name and every confirmed command need admin. | `TestAuthorize`, `TestClassify`, `FuzzPolicy`, `TestRunPowerVariantsPerRole`, `TestBareMqttUserStaysAdminOnly`, `TestBareReportsRouteLikeReadsButKeepTheirVerdicts`, `TestRunRefusesBeforeNetworkIO` |
| P6  | The role check happens in `devicecmd.Run`, before any network I/O, for every caller; roles below operator, above admin or unknown get nothing. Refusals are audited (`command.rejected`). | `TestRunRefusesBeforeNetworkIO`, `FuzzPolicy` |
| P7  | What is classified is what is sent: `Classify(Canonical(x))` equals `Classify(x)` and the device receives the canonical text. | `TestCanonicalIsWhatIsJudged`, `TestRunSendsTheCanonicalCommand`, `FuzzPolicy` |
| L1  | The audit log, the console history and error texts hold only `cmdpolicy.Redacted(cmd)`: an **allowlist of arguments**. Arguments appear only for operator-level commands and a short list of harmless settings (credential patterns scrubbed). Every other command, refused ones included, shows as `Name ***`, a malformed line as `[rejected: malformed command]`. A `Backlog` is shown part by part, each part redacted on its own. A secret wrapped in `Json`, `Rule`, `Publish` never reaches a log. | `TestRedactedForLog`, `TestRedactedScrubsArguments`, `TestSecretsNeverReachTheAuditLog`, `TestErrorsNeverEchoTheCommand`, `FuzzPolicy` |
| L2  | Device replies are shown only after `cmdpolicy.ScrubReply`: values of secret-looking keys (`password`, `passwd`, `pwd`, `token`, `secret`, `apikey`, `MqttUser`, `ssid`) and credential patterns in strings (URL userinfo, `[user:pass@host]`, `password=`) are masked; key order and numbers are kept. Replies are never written to the audit log. | `TestScrubReply`, `TestRunScrubsCredentialsFromReplies`, `TestRunBareMqttUserGoesOverMQTTAndIsMasked` |
| L3  | The console page never repeats text that the policy would not log: the input box and the confirmation step carry only loggable text (the command shown there is `Redacted`). **The "type the command again" step is superseded (2026-10-21):** the confirmation step names the consequence and posts the canonical command from the server-side session of the form, so nothing has to be retyped and no secret is echoed. Replies are HTML-escaped. | `TestConsoleDestructiveCommandAsksOnceNamingTheConsequence`, `TestConsoleReplyIsEscaped`, `TestConsoleCredentialCommandsAreConfirmedAndRedacted` |
| L4  | Power fragments pushed over SSE carry relay states only, escaped, no command text. | `TestPowerStateIsEscaped`, `TestSSEPublishesPowerFragment` |
| D1  | After the legacy "web log level too low" warning the HTTP client raises the level and repeats **only read-class commands**. A `Power TOGGLE` or `Restart 1` that the device already applied is never sent twice; the caller gets an error saying it was applied. | `TestClient_WebLogWarningNeverRepeatsStateChangingCommands`, `TestClient_WebLogQuirk` |
| D2  | How a command is routed is not who may send it. The transport routes a command as a read (MQTT first, and over HTTP a second time when MQTT gets no answer) only when `cmdpolicy.ReportsOnly` says it changes nothing: a read-class command, or the bare form of a name checked in the Tasmota source (`reportsWhenBare`: `MqttUser`, `OtaUrl`, `PowerRetain`, `LogHost`, `SwitchMode` and `SwitchMode1` to `SwitchMode28`). Never by a pattern: a generic name a rule may read stays a write. With a value, another index or inside a `Backlog` each stays a write, and its class, its role, its redaction and `StartsFirmware` stay what `Classify` says. | `TestReportsOnly`, `TestBareReportsRouteLikeReadsButKeepTheirVerdicts`, `TestBareMqttUserStaysAdminOnly`, `TestCommandActionIsWhatTheRouterDoes`, `TestSimBareSwitchModeIsReadOverMQTTUnderItsIndex`, `TestEveryBareCommandTheSettingsAndPolicyReadsSendIsRoutedAsARead`, `TestPolicyReadOfADeviceWhoseHTTPIsSilent`, `TestSettingsReadOfADeviceWhoseHTTPIsSilent` |

**Device settings editor, flash confirmation: superseded (2026-10-20, proportionate security).** The earlier rule asked for a required "flash wears out" confirmation and an optional "write to flash now" box. The page is admin-only, CSRF-protected and audited; the confirmation protected nothing the admin role does not already allow. Applying changes now always ends with exactly one `SaveData` write (`TestSettingsAlwaysSavesOnce`), so the result also holds with SaveData 0.

## Bulk send (2026-10-21)

`internal/web/bulkcommand.go` and `ota.Engine.SubmitCommand` send one command line to
several devices, admin only. The same `cmdpolicy` verdict, confirmation texts and
redaction as the console apply.

| ID  | Claim | Tests |
| --- | ----- | ----- |
| B1  | Admin only. The preview (targets, offline devices skipped, consequence) is the confirmation; the run takes command and devices from a single-use server-held token bound to the session, never from the form. Credential commands (`Redact`) are refused for bulk because the stored job would hold the value. | `TestBulkCommandPreviewThenRun`, `TestBulkCommandPreviewNamesTheConsequence`, `TestBulkCommandRefusals` |
| B2  | The job is not an OTA job: queued, applying, succeeded or failed with the compact reply as note. Before each step the creator is resolved again (role, disabled, gone) by the pair (sign-in method, subject), which the job stores (`created_kind`): subjects are not unique across methods. A local account only under the reserved `local:` prefix, which header and SSO users never resolve under; an SSO or header user only through a principal record written by the same method; unknown method, other method's record, no record or no role fails closed. anything but an active admin fails the step and is audited (`command.bulk.refused`). The command policy checks the role once more inside `devicecmd.Run`. A job found mid-send after a restart fails instead of being sent again. | `TestCommandStepFailsWhenTheCreatorIsDemotedDisabledOrGone`, `TestResolverSeparatesSignInMethodsThatShareASubject`, `TestResolverFailsClosed`, `TestCommandStepWithoutASignInMethodFails`, `TestCommandJobFoundSendingIsNotSentAgain`, `TestCommandJobSendsOnceAndKeepsTheReply` |
| B3  | A retry is admin-only (web and service), runs as the retrying admin, passes `Authorize` for every stored command, and asks for a new confirmation when a stored command has a consequence. | `TestCommandRetryRunsAsTheRetryingAdminOnly`, `TestCommandRetryChecksEveryStoredCommandAgainstThePolicy`, `TestCommandTransactionRetryNeedsAnAdminAndANewConfirmation` |
| B4  | Transaction pages show only `Redacted(command)`. | `TestCommandTransactionShowsOnlyTheRedactedCommand` |

Residual: the role of a single-sign-on or header user is the one in their principal
record (written at sign-in; for header users at most every few minutes), so a user
demoted at the identity provider is caught at their next sign-in. The principals
table has one row per subject: two methods using one subject overwrite each other's
record, and a job of the older one then fails closed.

## Policy rules for any Tasmota command (2026-10-29, #36)

A fleet policy rule may name any command that answers a plain query, not only the curated
settings. tasmofleet then sends the bare command name to every device on a timer and, on
"Make compliant", `<Command> <want>` without asking. So this path is stricter than the
console: it has no confirmation step.

| ID  | Claim | Tests |
| --- | ----- | ----- |
| G1  | `Status` is never sent by a rule, in any spelling: every name whose lower-case form starts with `status` (`Status`, `Status0`, `STATUS00`, `StatusSNS`, ...) is refused by `cmdpolicy.PolicyReadable`, with "Status commands are never sent automatically". This holds for the editor, the file import, the stored rules, the poller, the on-demand check, the MQTT listener and the fixer. | `TestPolicyReadableNeverAllowsStatusInAnySpelling`, `FuzzPolicyReadable`, `TestReadKeysNeverSendsADeniedCommand`, `TestPollerReadsGenericRulesAndNeverSendsADeniedCommand` |
| G2  | A rule's command must be one plain name (no blank, no `;`, no look-alike, at most 40 bytes), not a synonym (`SO19`; a named SetOption synonym such as `MqttTLS` or `DiscoverOff` passes this check and is refused by policy, G3), not secret (the names in `secretNames` and any name containing `password`, `passwd`, `pwd`, `token`, `secret`, `apikey`, `mqttuser`, `ssid` or `key`), and not one whose bare form acts: `Backlog*`, `Restart`, `Reset`, `Upgrade`, `Upload`, `SaveData`, `TelePeriod` (both are read through their Status block as curated settings), `Delay`, `Event`, `Publish*`, `Subscribe`, `Unsubscribe`, `Rule*`, `Timer*`, `Timers`, `Power` and `Power<n>`, `Sensor<n>`, `Driver<n>`, `Wifi*`, `Ping*`, `WakeUp*`, `Script*`, `Br*` (BrRestart), `Shutter*`, `Mp3*`, `RfKey*`, `Json`, `If`, `I2CScan`, `Buzzer`, `UfsRun`, `WebGetConfig`, `Telnet`, `SendMail`, `LoRaCommand`, `TCPStart`, `TCPConnect`, `BLEScan`, `WcInit`, `ZB*` and every `*Send`: their bare form acts. A second group reports when sent bare but restarts, locks out or actuates the device when set, so Make compliant must never send it: `Gpio*`, `Module`, `Modules`, `SetSensor`, `I2CDriver`, `MqttClient`, `GroupTopic`, `Prefix`, `Emulation`, `TuyaMCU`, `Eth*`, `MqttFingerprint`, `CpuFrequency` (restart); `DeepSleepTime`, `WebQuery`, `UfsDelete`, `UfsRename`, `Exception`, `FlashMode`, `Cfg*` (lock-out or action on the device); `Dimmer`, `Channel`, `Color`, `CT`, `White`, `HsbColor`, `PWM` (actuators, like `Power`); `PowerSet`, `PowerCal`, `EnergyReset` (corrupt calibration and counters). `StatusRetain` is refused on purpose, as every name starting with `status`. The list is a deny list: a new Tasmota command is readable until it is listed here. | `TestPolicyReadableDenyList`, `TestPolicyReadableAllowsPlainSettings`, `FuzzPolicyReadable` |
| G3  | A curated setting keeps its exact behaviour and its exact spelling: another letter case (`hostname`, `setoption19`) or an index the setting does not take (`Topic1`, `MqttHost0`, `FullTopic01`: Tasmota drops it and sets the setting) is refused, in a rule as in a line Make compliant sends, because it would skip the curated validation and the restart knowledge (#606). The same holds for a SetOption under another name: a SetOption synonym of any pinned Tasmota catalogue (`MqttTLS`, `MqttTLSFingerprint`, `MqttNoRetain`, `DiscoverOff`, `ChannelRemap`, with or without an index; write `SetOption103`) and a SetOption index or value with a leading 0 (`SetOption003`, `SetOption103 08`: Tasmota reads the index as a plain decimal with atoi, so `SetOption003` is `SetOption3` and is refused with that name; it reads the value with strtol base 0, so a leading 0 there is octal and the value is refused with "write the value as a plain decimal"). The deny list holds the commands known to restart or act; anything else is treated as non-restarting. | `TestQueryableGenericCommands`, `TestGenericCommandsDoNotRestartTheDevice`, `TestParseRulesGenericCommands`, `TestAnIndexedSpellingOfASettingIsThatSetting`, `TestASetOptionSynonymIsWrittenAsItsSetOption`, `TestAZeroPaddedSetOptionIsRefused` |
| G4  | The set form `<Command> <want>` must pass `cmdpolicy.Prepare(line, RoleAdmin)` with no `Confirm` and no `Redact`. A command that asks for a confirmation in the console (`Reset`, `Module`, `Template`, `Wifi` off, `WebServer` other than 2, `IPAddress`, `Ap`, firmware commands, credentials) can therefore never be a rule. The check runs when the rule is saved or imported and again in `Fixer` for every line before anything is sent. | `TestPolicySetText`, `TestParseRulesGenericCommands`, `TestCommandTextGeneric`, `TestFixerRefusesDeniedGenericLines` |
| G5  | A generic value is read live only, one command at a time, from a reply of exactly `{"<Command>": scalar}` (case-insensitive key); every other reply is "unknown". The raw reply goes through `ScrubReply` first and URL-like values through `settings.RedactURLCredentials`, so a credential never reaches the report, the live cache or the HTML. | `TestReadKeysGenericCommand`, `TestParseReplyKeepsGenericKeys`, `TestPollerReadsGenericRulesAndNeverSendsADeniedCommand` |
| G6  | Make compliant sends one `Backlog <Command> <want>` and one `SaveData`, then reads the value back. It is admin only (like every policy route) and the audit log holds `cmdpolicy.Redacted` text. | `TestFixerAppliesAndVerifiesAGenericRule`, `TestPolicyFixIsAdminOnly`, `TestPolicyRuleFreeCommandField`, `TestPolicyJobAuditUsesTheRedactedCommands` |

There is no per-rule read override in 0.18: a command the deny list refuses cannot be allowed
for one rule. A rule's expected value must equal what the device reports, written as the
device writes it (`ON` and `OFF` read as `1` and `0`).

## Maintenance

- **Rule (superseded 2026-10-21).** There is no `forbiddenNames` table and no
  allowlist any more. A command that destroys, strands or locks out a device gets a
  consequence text in `confirmFor`; everything else is a plain admin command.
- **Test-backed.** `TestDocListsEveryConfirmedName` fails when a name in `confirmFor` or
  `secretNames` is missing from the claims table above, so this document cannot fall
  behind the code. Each such name also needs a row in `TestClassify`.
- `FuzzPolicy` runs as a seed-corpus test in `make test`. Run it for a minute after
  any change to `cmdpolicy.go`: `go test ./internal/cmdpolicy -run xxx -fuzz FuzzPolicy -fuzztime 60s`.
- Mutation gate: `tools/mutation-gate.sh ./internal/cmdpolicy 90` (also in `make mutation`).

## Known gap: executors over HTTP

Commands that run other commands (`Json`, `Publish`, `Publish2`, `Rule` with a rule text, `WebSend`, `WebQuery`,
`Br`, `Script`, `UfsRun`) need no confirmation of their own for an admin over HTTP, so `Json {"Status":0}` or a
`Rule` that does `Status 0` reaches a device that way. The classification is by command name; making the policy
unwrap them is out of scope. Over MQTT the channel refuses all of them (docs/security/mqtt-transport.md, T1).

`TLSKey<n>` (the mutual-TLS client key of the MQTT connection) is a plain command in the list of settings that can
cut off a device reached over MQTT only (`cmdpolicy.CutOffName`): over MQTT it needs the console's confirmation,
and Make compliant skips it there.
